# SMART-LIVESTOCK-MOVEMENT-AND-GRAZING-TRACKER-UNDER-AGRIVOLTAIC-STRUCTURES
This project presents a Smart Livestock Movement and Grazing Tracker for agrivoltaic systems, integrating multiple IoT components for intelligent monitoring and control. An ESP32 at the geo-fence zone processes inputs from an RC522 RFID reader and a PIR motion sensor to identify livestock and detect motion near restricted areas; if motion is detected, a buzzer is triggered to drive livestock away before they approach the restricted zone. Each livestock unit is equipped with a collar-mounted ESP8266 and NEO-6M GPS module to monitor real-time location, with a buzzer on the collar activated when the animal crosses its designated grazing boundary. An ESP32-CAM captures and classifies grass conditions using Edge Impulse AI and streams the data. All modules communicate over Wi-Fi and send data to a centralized Google Sheet, which then updates an IoT dashboard for real-time visualization. Additionally, the Blynk platform provides alert notifications when an RFID tag is detected in a restricted area. This integrated system supports efficient geo-fencing, AI-based grass monitoring, and proactive alerts to enhance sustainability and livestock management in agrivoltaic environments.
